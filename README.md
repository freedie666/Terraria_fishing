## What is fishing in terraria

Fishing is an activity accomplished by using a Fishing Pole at a body of liquid (water, honey, or lava) while having bait in the player's inventory. While near the body of liquid, pressing the left mouse button at a point over the liquid will cast a line into the liquid. Pressing the button again when the bobber moves up and down will reel in the line and often an item will come up with the line.
